# Monocular-Visual-Inertial-Odometry
This contains the code(in development) for monocular visual odometry. The aim of the project is to implement feature based tracking methods and fuse the pose estimate with IMU on a crazyflie. 
This repository depends on:
1. Python 2.7
2. CV 3+
3. ETH Zurich ASL Dataset: http://robotics.ethz.ch/~asl-datasets/ijrr_euroc_mav_dataset/machine_hall/MH_01_easy/

To run this, edit the path in test.py to where your dataset is stored.
